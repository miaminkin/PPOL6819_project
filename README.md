**Project Title**: Predicting the Impact of the Expanded Child Tax Credit on Voter Turnout in the United States

**Authors**:

**Overview**:
This project investigates the potential impact of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC), introduced under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), on the voter turnout rate in the United States. Using microsimulations and machine learning models, the study explores the relationship between increased income due to the CTC expansion and the likelihood of participating in federal elections.

**Data Sources**: 
The project uses data from two main sources:

1. [Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-asec.html): Provides detailed socio-economic data necessary for simulating CTC benefits.
2. [Voting Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-supp_cps-repwgt/cps-voting.html): Offers essential variables for understanding voting behavior.
